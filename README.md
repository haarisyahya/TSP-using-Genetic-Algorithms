# TSP-using-Genetic-Algorithms
In this assignment and document, the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is solved by implementing a Genetic Algorithm (GA) capable of executing any number of input parameter combinations such that the user is able to explore strategic mutation rates, crossover rates, tournament k-values, crossover types, population sizes, and number of generations.
